# Servo Motor

A servo motor is a type of rotary actuator used for precise control. It is made up of a controller, a feedback mechanism, and an electric motor. More so than any other kind of motor, they can tolerate complex motion patterns and profiles. Despite their diminutive size, they are incredibly energy-efficient and have a lot of power.

### component

1- Servo motor

2- Arduino







### Code explanation

We used a library in Servo motor ((“Servo.h”)).

To move the Motor servo we needed two Method 

attach();
  write();

And of course at the end we need the loop to animate.
